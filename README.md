# My-Image-Algorithm-And-Resulting-Art
The results of my algorithm and the art that it produces that Iâ€™m soon selling at doctors offices and galleries and private buyers, on demand images are also an option but for a higher, much much higher price than the art I produce on my own.

credits to: NASA or JPL or USGS or others (nasas website doesnt include these tags within the images when you download them so when you download thousands, you have no clue whats from where at the end. i mean how about initials within the filename huh? boom solved and let people know whats what and its all easily credited, but im assuming that since its from NASAs website, its credited to nasa?) idk but when i asked them if i could sell my work they didnt say no, and for that im so greatful and prase you all to everyone i know. you all have no clue how greatful i am that you all have allowed this (i know it counts as allowed based off the rules but, the fact they didnt say no, still means a lot.)

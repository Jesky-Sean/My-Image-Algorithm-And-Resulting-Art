*my personal Algorithms novel mathemamatical method using matrices and the resulting Art created, by: sean Jesky for the american dream.!*[image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70482729-f9b0-4aa0-8720-bec8e1932282)

*a select few printings; here im showing those results of a new, novel mathemamatical method for calculating matrices by me and shows a new understanding of other ways to use matrices, and performing calculations based off the theories ive designed*
(I plan to release the algorithm, and associated math theories ive devised to create it (though id prob. be wrong as i have no
formal math training for explaing, i only taught myself how to do), or sell it one day, but for now im keeping it for my enjoyment of its use and to learn more of the theory i created), *for which, i was able to convert this theory of mine into the algorithm ive used, and created, and designed for this theory: [not explained or told publicly yet], these images show a few of my algs; from alg-0 to alg-3 that were used*


# My current estimates
*(pros. est. way more than i was going to sell, for ex. they said the large one should sell for <2k, but eh.. if i was losing 50% on comission, then i would for the pro. est. but if i can get it in the hands of people who want nice but cant afford 2k but 750, than that would make me feel better:*

large one: *$750.00*
small:     *$350.00*
smaller:   *150.00* 

# Notes.
Iâ€™m soon selling at doctors offices and galleries and private buyers!!! ive worked so hard for this an im so close to all my dreams, minus the greatest one, and ill never see her again prob. ðŸ˜”

!also, on demand images are also an option to sell one day, but for a higher, much much higher price than the art I produce on my own.!

The images I create from the originals places the original filename at the top when the image I create, so anyone can go see the original from nasas website if requested or required or wished by a buyer or potental buyer. 

â€¢No AI helped with the creation of the algorithm, or the art, additionally, no computer graphics programs from a 3rd party, or any other programs other than my algorithm, no nothing but my own sets of equations were used to produce these images, its something im very proud of being self taught in almost everything i know. 5 years of study 3am to 8ish pm - every single day - all to one day have the american dream. although i have used a 3rd party printer because i dont have a printer to produce ultra-high-quality archive grade images.â€¢



# Credits
*original images i used to produce my images belong to: NASA or JPL or USGS or others, but the resulting image is at a bit by bit level, original for each image, but without them none of this would be as fun nor would i have had such an exellent and great selection of images from such incredible satalites they operate and share with the intent of new discoverys and dreams*

*(nasas website doesnt include these tags within the images when you download them so when you download thousands, you have no clue whats from where at the end. i mean how about initials within the filename huh? boom solved and let people know whats what and its all easily credited, but im assuming that since its from NASAs website, its credited to nasa?) idk but when i asked them if i could sell my work they didnt say no, and for that im so greatful and prase you all to everyone i know. you all have no clue how greatful i am that you all have allowed this (i know it counts as allowed based off the rules but, the fact they didnt say no, still means a lot.)*
